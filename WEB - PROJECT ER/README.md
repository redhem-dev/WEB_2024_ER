IMS --> Inventory Management System


Repository for WEB PROGRAMMING COURSE PROJECT

Short description?

What is the IDEA of IMS? --> 
    
    Imagine that you are part of the community/company that has to keep track of all of the products coming in and out of your storages/stores. And sometimes your assumed quantity does not exactly match your actual quantity. 

    How can I fix this problem? Well, for starters it would be necessary to make the count of products in the beginning, and all the later counting would be done by system. You would always know which products are available and how much, you would get notified if some product is on low quantity or if it's quantity is 0. 

    What if there are irregularitites? Irregularities are being dealt with by the commit history. Each time the quantities are being updated, person who did it is being taken into one commit, along with the date, time, product ID, commit ID, and reason for updating. This is done so that the chance for mistake is minimized.

    Incoming/Outgoing shipments are there to implement the commit history idea and to actually implement the updating of the quantities of products. You must give all the information necessary to fill one history commit.

    Furthermore, if there is a new product to be added, you can do so by opening inventory and clicking on add product button. You will get a form to input all necessary information for adding the new product to the inventory. This will also be noted as the commit in Inventory History.

    Regarding the searcihng of products in the Check Availability section, it works on a principle of product ID as a priority, but String can also be implemented as search option. You will be diplayed with either Available - GREEN or Not Available - RED.
